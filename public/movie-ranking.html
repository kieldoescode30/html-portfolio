    <h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Your Name</h3>

    <p>Your Name is the end product of years of experimentation with storytelling and filmmaking â€“ the story that Shinkai has always wanted, and tried, to tell, finally made real, and done so in a satisfying, entertaining, and heart-wrenching way. Beautiful sceneries made me want to go to Japan someday and the soundtracks are indeed a masterpiece.</p>

    <h3>Elemental</h3>

    <p>Cute movie and pleasantly heart-warming.</p>

    <h3>Hello World</h3>
    <img src="../assets/images/hello-world-poster.jpg" alt="hello world movie poster" height="300px" width="200px">
    <p>It's a cinematic masterpiece and heart-warming soundtracks that has left a everlasting memory in my heart that I'll cherish forever. Without a doubt one of the best anime movies.</p>

    <h3>Her Blue Sky</h3>
    <img src="../assets/images/her-blue-sky-poster.jpg" alt="her blue sky movie poster" height="300px">
    <p>The movie has an element of realism and a pinch of romance in it. It was one of the first movies that I watched at cinemas and the soundtrack really made me my eyes teary.</p>

    <h3>A Silent Voice</h3>

    <p>Outstanding storyline and beautiful movie, and there wans't a single moment or scene in which I lost interest.</p>
